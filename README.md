# Weather Data Fetcher

This project fetches current weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and stores it in a SQLite database.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Setup

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the required packages by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Open the `weather_data_fetcher.py` file in a text editor.

2. (Optional) Modify the `CITY` variable to change the city for which you want to fetch weather data. By default, it's set to "London".

3. Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal:

python weather_data_fetcher.py

4. The script will fetch the current weather data for the specified city and store it in a SQLite database named `weather_data.db`.

5. Upon successful execution, you will see output similar to:

Weather data for London has been successfully fetched and stored in the database.
Last stored weather data:
City: London
Temperature: 15.5Â°C
Description: partly cloudy
Humidity: 76%
Timestamp: 2023-07-07 14:30:15

## File Structure

- `weather_data_fetcher.py`: The main Python script that fetches weather data and stores it in the database.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required for this project.
- `weather_data.db`: SQLite database file (created when the script is run) that stores the weather data.
- `README.md`: This file, containing project information and instructions.

## Database Schema

The script creates a `weather` table in the SQLite database with the following structure:

- `id`: INTEGER (Primary Key, Auto-increment)
- `city`: TEXT
- `temperature`: REAL
- `description`: TEXT
- `humidity`: INTEGER
- `timestamp`: DATETIME (Default: current timestamp)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Ensure you have a working internet connection.
2. Verify that you've installed all required packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Check that you have write permissions in the project directory (for creating the database file).

## Note

This project uses a free API key from OpenWeatherMap. If you plan to use this script extensively or for commercial purposes, please obtain your own API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys).
